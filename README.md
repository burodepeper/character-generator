# Character Generator

This is a **work in progress**, of course.

## Description

I like to base short stories (about 300 words) I write for <http://plaspauzepoezie.nl> on imaginary characters, that are just a little of(f?). This script is an attempt to automate and randomize this process, and to get myself accustomed to/with node.js.

## Roadmap

- 0.1.0 - Get something running via the command line (I suppose?)
- 0.2.0 - Create a better roadmap
