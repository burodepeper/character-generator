# Character Generator

## Description

I like to write short stories (~ 300 words) about specific quirks of random people. The ultimate purpose of this generator is to generate a character, up to a certain level of details, which allows me to quickly base a new story upon.

As such, the program will simulate a persons life, and more specifically how certain aspects of that person develop. Ideally, this will give me something approaching realism, but with some quirks added.

- The characters will be Western, in particular Dutch. They might share characterics with more 'exotic' (grand)parents.
- I will try to use real data as much as possible.

### Usage

`node generate.js`

## Roadmap

- <s>0.1.0: Get something running via the command line</s>
  - <s>0.1.1: Import stats via .json</s>
- 0.2.0: Think of a better roadmap/simulation

## Characteristics

### Goals for 0.2.0

- Date of birth
